**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
- I'm always frustrated when I can't easily find and see the past messages in Discord App.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
- Adding functions(can be creating icon), that make possible to search the specific and words in chats. Then I would like to be able to see my past messages that is important very easily and fast.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Instead of putting search box to look over the past messages,  I could put the Magnifier icon to see messages for the specific date that I wanted to search.
