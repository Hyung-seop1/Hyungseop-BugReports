**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I often find it difficult to keep track of my assignments and deadlines using "e-conestoga" website. 
To check the due dates of assignments or see what assignments are remaining, I need to click on each class and then view the plan. I find it very inconvenient to have to click multiple times for this.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great if there were a feature on the website to follow up on assignments. For example, creating a single calendar with categories where I can check deadlines or see what assignments are remaining would be very helpful.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I'm currently managing the specifics of assignments for each subject by creating separate items in Excel. However, if the website were to incorporate features to alleviate this inconvenience, such as a function to quickly identify assignments and reduce the hassle, I would be highly satisfied.
